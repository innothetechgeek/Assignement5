I've chosen my domain to build a mobile application for an Animal pound. An animal pound is a place where lost or abonded animals are brought and adopted. As a 'Customer', you have to make a appointment('Schedule') before you come and adopt an 'Animal'. There is 3 'ScheduleTypes', a customer could be scheduled to come in the morning, evening or at dawn. When a customer comes to adopt an Animal their details are stored in the system, along with the details of the animal they adopted. This enable the Animal pound owner to view all adoptions made with in a particular period of time. Aniamals of the same breed can live in the same 'livingArea'. Many different animals can use the same treatment. 'Treatment suppliers' are stored in the database as well, so that if a particular supplier gives a wrong 'Treatment'and an animals dies, they can be sued. MedicalHistory of each and every animal is stored in the database, so if an animal dies the owner will know what it died of. The basic operations that this system will perform is the adding, viewing and deletion of animals to and from the database.
